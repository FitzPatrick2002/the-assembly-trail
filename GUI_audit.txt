Left(Main) Monitor: 
- Maybe text a bit smaller
- Scrollbar must be removed or hidden (its a rule of good tone since it destroys the atmosphere of UI)
- Text closer to retro (like follout1&2)?

*To textBoxs in particular:
- it should be a bit smaller then frame 
- background of textBox must be the same or close enough to monitor
*Alternatively
- take bg with holes that I just made
- place TextBox under the bg

Right(Map) Monitor:
- background of textBox must be the same or close enough to monitor
- it should be a bit smaller then frame.(or apply the same alternative trick)
- text must be the same by style as in Left Monitor
- content of it must be a map, that can be found as ASCII_map.txt in our root

Button Panel (on the right):
- buttons must be placed according to schema (that means one under another without or with micro indent)



Green and Red Button:
- do not modify the scale and size of buttons. They are ready for deployment
- remove their background. (I know that hitbox is needed. However it can be invisible)
- by default buttons are at phase OFF
- if a choice appear, they must be ON until the choice taken(just explanation why there is 2 types of each button)

Green and Red Button Hover:
- Background change must be removed
- in OFF mode must not respond to user
- in ON mode you can add "changing Y by -1 (or very small parameter) and than return back" (effect that you touched the button by finger)

Green and Red Button Click:
- in OFF mode must not respond to user
- Background change must be removed
- in ON mode, Y must be modified by -10px, for example. Like you clicked on it (holed bg can be useful)


CORE_STATUS button (blue one):
- must be deployed on position
- other aspects are the same as in previous buttons
- unlike other buttons, always responds on hover and click at any mode
- On click changes mode to ON. If you click again, it must return to OFF. (This button is responsible for displaying benchmark test of our app)
