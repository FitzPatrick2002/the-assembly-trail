A quick todo for myself

0. Documentation
 - player.inc (ok)
 - player.asm (ok)
 - utils.inc  (ok)
 - utils.asm  (ok)
 - rooms.inc  (ok)
 - room.asm   (ok)

1. utils.h 
 - getUserInputString (ok, partially)
 - fitTimeFrame   (ok)
 - charCompare	  (ok)
 - getUserYNinput (ok)
 - checkIfInArray (ok)
 - roomNumberHex  (ok)

 2. main.cpp
 
 - (ok) main loop (in progress)
 - (ok) conditions in main loop (ok)

 2.5 rooms.asm

 - (ok) isSingleTimeEvent -> implement (ok)
 - (ok) Use isSingleTimeEventProc in rooms.asm (ok)
 - Check if single time events are becoming null: 	mov [esi].Room.eventsList[edi * 4], 0

 3. Fixes
 
 * rooms.asm
  # loadEvent()
	(ok) - nrand -> not really random it seems to me? See how danil did this (ok)

* Somewhere
 # (ok) Fix addressing so that [] is used instead of adding edx / other to offset
 # (ok) When listing the rooms to which player can go, list them using hexadecimal, not octal (ok)

 # events (Danill) -> no YN output before prompting player for input
 # events (Danill) -> player struct is not affected by events as they are not using it but the placeholders

 # events (Danill) -> Description of hiding spots is not correctly changed for each room

 # (ok) Sometimes when going back to room '0' from room '3', a double #------#, #-----# appears. (ok - just leave it)
	-> Caused by default behaviour. If there is no event, loadRoom prints #-----# at the end of execution
	   and after loadRoom if there is no event changeRoom is executed, which prints #-----# at the beginning

 # (ok) When input '0' when changing rooms, its not allowed even if 0th room is on list of connections, player is stuck (ok)

 # (ok) Somewhere there is USING eax, for proc which returns through eax
 # (ok) Fix randomness (ok)

 4. Termination

 - Remove / comment out test functions? 
   Store them in some separate file outside the main code?
